# YT Speed

Shortcuts for speeding up Youtube with GreaseMonkey / TamperMonkey / FireMonkey.

Based on https://gist.github.com/RaresGeo/22dfa7e381c881a8fc081edc8a8a8bb8

Note: It only works on the main Youtube website, not embedded videos.

## Usage

- `v` to speed up to 1.75x
- `b` to speed up to 2x
- `z` to speed down by 0.25x
- `x` to reset speed to 1x

Note: The "Playback speed" menu item in the Youtube UI will not change with this tool (not synced). However, a short label with the speed is displayed by the script on the top left when changed by the user or when a new video starts playing.
